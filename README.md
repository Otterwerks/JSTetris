## Motivation

I decided to do a remake of a classic arcade game as an introduction to Javascript. I chose to make Tetris because it was always my favorite game as a kid and playing it brings back a great sense of nostalgia.

## Technical

### Game
- HTML
- Javascript

### Server
- Node JS
- Express JS
- Mongo DB
